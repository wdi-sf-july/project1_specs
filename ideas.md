## Option 1: Online Gaming Portal

You are going to corner the online gaming world with a new approach to old classics; starting with tic-tac-toe (a.k.a noughts and crosses).

Your app will allow users to register and then start new games which they can play against a friend or the computer. They will be able to see a list of the previous games they have played, and a running score of wins/losses.

## Option 2: GA Schedule Planner

GA just keeps growing and growing. They need a new app to manage courses, students, instructors and classrooms.

You are going to develop an app to handle the planning and booking, and to allow students and staff to access all the information. 

It's very important that students are restricted in their abilities in the app, and that GA Staff can manage the system.

## Option 3: Music self-publishing site

A collective of underground DJs have gotten together to launch a service to allow budding creatives to upload songs they produced, and take feedback from other users of the site.

The collective's spokesman is most concerned that we're able to express the individual character of the musicians through the design, and that it's easy to moderate comments, since they expect lots of trolls and spammers to bombard their site.
